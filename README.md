# Polynomials library

Small Eigen-based library for playing with polynomials and auto-differentiation

* Both fixed and dynamic degree (or max-degree) polynomials are supported
* Fixed / dynamic degrees can be mixed and matched in any sensible form
* Root finding friendly to ceres::Jet
* Pretty-printing

# TODO:

* Operators `+= -= *=`
* Division and modulo operations
* Sturm-sequences based solver
* Usage examples
* Expression interface
* Positive-definite and monothonic polynomials
